	<p>Hey there, my name's Wyatt! I'm a Front-End Web Developer and Technical Support Manager hailing from Central Ohio. I've been developing websites and email campaigns for about 6 years using HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, WordPress, and a sprinkle of PHP. I've coded various websites for small businesses, universities, and bigger brands with boutique agencies in New York, Cincinnati, and LA.</p>

	<p>While a Front-End Developer by night, my current job entails fixing those nasty computer and software issues, updating/editing/maintaining domestic and franchise websites, performing monthly audits, and maintaining CRM accounts among a multitude of other tasks.</p>

	<p>I've coded several small business websites such as Monster Bars, Village Arts Center, k-Squared, and Pathos Restaurant, tweaked the inner workings for Turman, Ettore, Certified Kitchens, and many more sites. I've also whipped together several email campaigns for companies like Roxio, Vode, Clorox, National University, and Church Insurance.</p>

	<p>My heart lies in the Web Development field. I'm constantly pushing myself to learn new things, further my career, meet new people, and deepen my knowledge as a developer. I invite criticism, I take chances, and I love to learn. There is nothing more satisfying to me than being faced with a challenge and conquering it.</p>
